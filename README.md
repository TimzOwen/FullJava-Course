## Get familiar with some Java General Knowldge.

### Classes and Objects

__Class__: is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which a __objects__ are created

Example: (insert picture of Dog): Datamember-->breed
                                  Method-->(Running/ Eating)

__Object__: Self contained component which contain state/attributes/behaviour or method

    are also instances of the class

### JDK , JRE and JVM?


__JDK__: software development environment used for developing java application and appletss.

    Includes Java Runtime Envinroment (JRE), an interperter/Loader (java), a compiler (javac),

    an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed on java development

__JVM__: converts byte code to machine specific code. Its interface does not depend on hardware.

    Its platform dependent and provides core java functions like Garbage Collection

### Java is platform independent?

Supports the (Write once Run anywhare) . When running a java program it gets converted to byte code 

from source code. With JVM java is independednt on machine's hardware

### Garbage Collection

During this process, memory used by the object is automatically returned once all reference are gone.
